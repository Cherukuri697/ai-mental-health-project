# MindMate – AI-powered Mental Health Companion

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

MindMate is an AI-powered mental health companion designed to support individuals experiencing stress, anxiety, or depression. It provides real-time mood tracking, personalized coping strategies, and access to mental wellness resources through a user-friendly mobile app.

## Background

Mental health issues are rising globally, especially among younger demographics. Many people lack access to timely, affordable support. This app seeks to close that gap by offering an accessible, always-available companion that provides mental health support.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Limited access to therapy or professional support
* Mental health stigma and reluctance to seek help
* Need for daily emotional check-ins and self-care guidance

## How is it used?

Users interact with MindMate through a mobile app interface. They can check in with their mood, talk to a chatbot trained in cognitive behavioral techniques, and receive suggested exercises or content based on their emotional state. In crisis moments, the app can guide users to professional help or emergency services.

## Data sources and AI methods

MindMate will utilize:
* Public mental health datasets (e.g., [Kaggle Mental Health Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets))
* User input (text and emotion logs) with strict privacy guidelines
* AI techniques: Sentiment analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning for content personalization

| Component        | AI Method                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Mood detection   | Sentiment analysis/NLP     |
| Chat interaction | Transformer-based models   |
| Personalization  | Reinforcement learning     |

## Challenges

* It cannot replace professional diagnosis or therapy.
* Must handle user privacy and data sensitivity responsibly.
* Bias in datasets or AI responses may lead to misleading outcomes.
* Users in critical mental states may need more than the app can provide.

## What next?

MindMate could be expanded with:
* Voice-based emotional analysis
* Integration with wearable devices for physiological data
* Multilingual support to broaden accessibility
Collaboration with mental health professionals and developers will be crucial to refining the AI and ensuring ethical deployment.
